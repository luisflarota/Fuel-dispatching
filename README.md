## Methodology

### Data Collection

![Mine Z Haulage Fleet](methodata.pdf)

- Data Retrieved from FMS
- MF is the match factor, calculated by dividing the sum of truck loading times by the product of the total loaders and the average truck cycle time (Burt and Caccetta (2007)).

### Machine Learning

- Features & Labels: Feature: EFH (m), truck model, payload (tons); Label: Fuel consumed (L)
- Machine learning algorithms: 6 supervised ML algorithms
- Tuning: Grid search, cross-validation
- Selection: Accuracy (R-squared), simplicity (tuning time)
- Coding Environment: Python, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow

### Optimization

- Optimization model: Binary integer programming model
- Objective Functions: Maximize match factor
- Decision variables: If truck h is sent to fuel at time t
- Constraints:
  - -<20% fuel ratio trucks refueled;
  - -Trucks avoid simultaneous refueling;
  - -Trucks fueling only once;
  - -15-minute refueling window;
  - -0% minimum fuel level ensured.
- Coding Environment: Python & Gurobi

| Random Forest Regression            | 64%        | 109ms         | 1m 07s        |
| **Artificial Neural Network**       | **90%**    |  **65ms**     | **21hr 17min**|

### Optimization

- First Formulation (Fuel time window):
  - (1) Infeasible model,
  - (2) impractical to adjust truck-shovel allocations.

- Adjustment First Formulation:
  - (1) Penalty for overlapping fueling,
  - (2) non-linearity issue, and
  - (3) variables and constraints = more time.

- Second Formulation (No fuel time window):
  - (1) Feasible (+optimal) model,
  - (2) Match factor improvement (avg.): 1 point, and
  - (3) arrival difference (avg.): 10-minute difference.
